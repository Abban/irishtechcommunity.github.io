Every Monday at 8pm, #diversity discusses a different piece of diversity-related writing
from activists that we admire.

Our aim is to highlight the incredible work done by diversity activists, and to provide a space
for people to discuss their work in an open and considered manner.

Everyone who wishes to participate will be given an opportunity to offer their thoughts or 
a related anecdote to what they have read. Nobody is allowed to respond to another person or ask 
a question until all participants have been given a chance to offer their thoughts. From that point on,
respectful discussion is encouraged - but no participant should feel obliged to continue to participate or
answer any question.

All interactions must adhere to the Irish Tech Community's [Code of Conduct](/codeofconduct).

The reading list can be added to by pull-request on our [Github](https://github.com/IrishTechCommunity/irishtechcommunity.github.io)
or, if you don't have a Github, by pinging an admin or posting in #diversity on Slack.
